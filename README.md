# SMU-QF
Codifying the mathematics taught in Quantitative Finance Modules under SMU

### [QF101](QF101.ipynb)
It covers the foundational mathematical concepts and techniques that are used in quantitative modelling. Attention is given to topics such as rules for functions, solving systems of linear equations, solutions of differential equations,option pricing application, and optimization. This course provides the mathematical tools that can be used to solve problems encountered in financial markets. 

### [QF208](QF208.ipynb)
This course consists of two parts. The first part covers matrices (including matrix operations, inversion) and systems of linear equations (including their solutions by Gauss elimination and matrix operations). Determinants, euclidean space, general vector spaces, sub-spaces idea, linear independence, dimension, row, column, and null spaces concepts will be introduced. We will also discuss norms, distance ideas, operations such as inner product, concepts of orthogonal bases, and Gram-Schmidt process. eigenvalues, eigenvectors, eigenspaces, eigenbases and their applications. The second part of the course introduces students to a variety of classical numerical methods, such as numerically solving equations and equation systems (linear and nonlinear), numerical interpolation and integration, and Monte Carlo simulation, etc. We also apply these methods to solve problems raised from many areas of quantitative finance, data science, and econometrics.
